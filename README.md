# Project 1: Python-Based Chat Application (Client-Server Model)

## 📝 Objective:

Developed a real-time chat application using Python's socket programming to facilitate communication between multiple clients through a centralized server.

## 💡 Key Features:

• Client-Server Architecture: Implemented a server that manages incoming
client connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

• Concurrent Client Handling: Utilized Python's threading module to allow the
server to handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.

• Real-Time Communication: Enabled clients to send and receive messages
instantly, ensuring seamless interaction.

• Graceful Disconnection: Clients can exit the chat by typing 'exit', ensuring a
clean shutdown of the connection.

## 🛠 Technical Stack:

• Programming Language: Python

• Libraries Used: socket for network communication, threading for handling
multiple connections concurrently.

## 🔍 Purpose & Outcome:

This project demonstrates proficiency in network programming and concurrency in Python. It showcases the ability to build foundational communication tools, emphasizing real-time data exchange and multi-threaded application design.

# Project 2: Random Password Generator – Python Project

## 📝 Objective

This project is a Python-based random password generator that allows users to create secure passwords of customizable length. The main objective is to ensure password strength by randomly selecting a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, reducing the risk of brute-force attacks.

## 💡 Key Features:

Custom Length Selection: Users can input the desired length of the password.

Randomized Output: Utilizes Python's random and string libraries to ensure strong and unpredictable password generation.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive interface using input() and print() for ease of use.

## 🛠 Technologies Used:

Python (core language)

Libraries: random, string

## 🔍 Purpose & Outcome:

The goal was to develop a utility that promotes cybersecurity awareness by demonstrating how strong passwords can be generated automatically. It also helped me practice basic Python programming, user interaction, and logic building.

# Project 3: BMI Calculator – Python Project

## 📝 Objective

This is a Python-based Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator that computes an individual's BMI based on user input (height and weight) and classifies their health status accordingly.

## 💡 Key Features:

User Input: Accepts height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) from the user.

BMI Calculation: Applies the standard BMI formula:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}\color[rgb]{0.6,0.6,0.6}{\boldsymbol{\textbf{BMI}}=\frac{\textbf{weight(kg)}}{\textbf{height(m)}^2}}" alt="BMI Formula">
</p>

Health Status Classification: Based on BMI value, the result is categorized as:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obese

## 🛠 Technologies Used:

Python (core logic)

Libraries: Basic built-in functions (input(), conditional statements)

## 🔍 Purpose & Learning Outcome:

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python basics, conditionals, and user interaction. It also demonstrates how coding can be applied to solve real-world problems in health and wellness.
